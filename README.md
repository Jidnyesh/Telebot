# Telebot
<h2>By JYDNX</h2>

If your website has new posts uploading daily and you wanna put it into your telegram channel without hassle, this is the right place.


1. Get you `sitemap.xml` ready or any `.xml` sitemap for your website and put it inside the `URL` variable in the code.<br><br>
2. Get the access token. This can be obtained by messaging `@BotFather` on Telegram and then add the Access keys to the `Access Key` variable in the Code.<br><br>
3. Get your chat ID. If it is a public channel, the chat ID will be ```@yourchannelname```. Add this to the CHAT_ID variable. [ Search online for chat id's of private channels ]<br> <br>
4. Then run ```pip install -r requirements``` in the Telebot directory<br><br>
5. You are good to go. Either double click the file or just run `python extract.py`
